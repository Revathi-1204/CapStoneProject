            <h2>Step 1: Receiving Porting Request</h2>
            <p>The MNPSP receives the porting request from the RO.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Verification by MNPSP</h2>
            <p>The MNPSP performs various verifications, including checking whether the mobile number has been ported earlier and if a specific period has elapsed since its last porting. They also verify if there is no pending porting request for the same mobile number.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h2>Step 3: Request Forwarding to DO</h2>
            <p>If all verification conditions are satisfied, the MNPSP forwards the request to the Donor Operator (DO). Otherwise, they reject the current request for porting and communicate the rejection to the RO, which then informs the subscriber.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Donor Operator Clearance</h2>
            <p>Upon receiving the porting request forwarded by the MNPSP, the DO verifies the clearance on nine grounds of rejection within four working days.</p>
