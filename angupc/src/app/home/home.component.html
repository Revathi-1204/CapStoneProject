            <h2>Step 1: Request Initiation</h2>
            <p>The subscriber initiates the MNP process by sending a request to the Donor Operator through Short Message Service (SMS) to Short Code 1900 or by calling the number '1900'.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h2>Step 2: Request Verification</h2>
            <p>The Donor Operator (DO) receives the request and matches the indicator (mobile number) with the number to be ported. They send back an automated system-generated SMS containing a Unique Porting Code (UPC) immediately. The UPC is valid for fifteen days, except in specific regions where it's valid for thirty days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h2>Step 3: Subscriber Documentation</h2>
            <p>The subscriber, upon receiving the UPC, submits a porting request along with the Customer Acquisition Form (CAF) as specified by the Recipient Operator (RO). The subscriber must provide all required documents, such as a copy of the last bill for postpaid subscribers or an authorization letter from the authorized signatory for corporate mobile numbers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h2>Step 4: Forwarding to MNP Service Provider</h2>
            <p>The UPC, along with other key details (Mobile number, UPC, date of receipt of porting request, Donor operator), is filled in the porting form (CAF) and submitted to the RO. The RO then forwards the porting request to the respective Mobile Number Portability Service Provider (MNPSP).</p>
